"The Red Ribbon Express (RRE) is the worldâ€™s largest mass mobilisation  drive  on  HIV/AIDS.  The train  will travel through 22 states, during its one year long journey, halting at 152 stations. Through the RRE, NACO, intends to break the  silence  surrounding  the  issue  of  HIV/AIDS,  by  taking the messages on prevention, care and support to people living in small towns and villages across the country. The aim  is  also  to  create  an  environment,  free  from  stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV, so they can access the services, without fear and prejudice, and live a life of dignity. It has proved to be a successful multi- sectoral initiative, of the NACO and a powerful advocacy tool, both at the state and district level, besides enhancing local capacity to deal with HIV prevention.","",""
