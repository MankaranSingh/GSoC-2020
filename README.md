# Abstract
- ## Programming Language Classification Task:

	The current methods of programming language classification (like linguists, pygments) rely heavily on custom handcrafted rules for many of it's classification tasks. Although handcrafted rules do a good job making file-level language predictions, its performance declines considerably when files use unexpected naming conventions and, crucially, when a file extension is not provided. Handcrafting rules brings along some major problems with it :

	-  Less accuracy.
	-  Easily fails on edge cases.
	-  Requires fair amount of time in manually thinking and implementing rules.
	-  Adding a new language in database for classification not so easy.

	File names and extensions, while providing a good indication of what the coding language is likely to be, do not offer the full picture. Machine learning algorithms are widely used for automating the process of handcrafting rules and may surpass the performance and accuracy for a given task. A machine learning model would rather learn the **vocabulary** of various languages (like humans do) to classify the programming language. Machine Learning algorithms are widely used in Language Processing tasks and have surpassed the performance of conventional approaches  in good amount of cases . This approach can work from file level or snippet level to potentially line-level language detection and classification.

	## Why is this needed ? 
	
	Accurate classification of programming language is an important task as :
	- It would be easier to extract information about which other libraries and frameworks are imported, as our search has been narrowed down to a specific programming language.  
	- Easier security vulnerability alerting 
	- Accurate picture about the % ages of programming languages used for a project. 
	- More relevant information extraction from text file in context of programming language.
	- More accurately determining the purpose of a file. 
	- And possibly, many others.

	Even  GitHub has agreed to the fact that their current solution of programming language detection *'Linguist'* isn't that accurate and fails miserably  when files use unexpected naming conventions and, crucially, when a file extension is not provided.
	
- ## File Purpose Classification Task:
	A certain project consists of many files that can be categorized into following categories: 
	
	 - Test files
	 - Documentation files
	 - Configuration files
	 - Build scripts
	 - Example Scripts
	 - Core Code
	 - Others (to be discussed)
	 
	 ## Why is this needed ? 
	 
	 This is important because, for example, the license of core code may be more 			important than the license of test code, example code, etc. Classifying the files into these help us to prioritize and emphasize on the licenses of certain categories. This is similar to the concept of "facets" from the Clearly Defined project. 
	 Different techniques to accomplish this task (including machine learning) would be discussed below.



# Technical Details

 ## Programming Language Classification Task:

**Note: All thing things written below have been verified and performed in the following [notebook](https://github.com/MankaranSingh/GSoC-2020/blob/master/Programming%20Language%20classification/notebooks/All%20Models.ipynb):**
*The Dataset used in the notebook is not the one specified here*

Machine learning is replacing conventional methods of solving a specific problem but one cannot 'just replace' the conventional methods with some fancy machine learning algorithms the reason being:
 
- Machine learning may be computationally expensive.
- Inference time of machine learning algorithms may be larger than conventional algorithms.
- The size of a machine learning model may be huge, ultimately increasing the size of the project.

Now, using machine learning instead of existing conventional approaches is viable only if:

- There are large gains upon accuracy over conventional approaches.
- The developed machine learning solution is not very computationally expensive and runs fast.
- The solution is easy to integrate into the existing workflow.
- The solution is easy to distribute, maintain and is flexible.

From my research, i have found that using machine learning for this use case is a viable option.

GitHub is moving from it's existing solution 'Linguist' to a machine learning based solution named as 'OctoLingua' - [source](https://github.blog/2019-07-02-c-or-java-typescript-or-javascript-machine-learning-based-classification-of-programming-languages/)
The following results were obtained using OctoLingua. We can see that OctoLingua maintains a good performance under various conditions, suggesting that the model learns primarily from the vocabulary of the code, rather than from meta information (i.e. file extension), whereas Linguist fails as soon as the information on file extensions is altered.

![Figure 1](https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/7935808/60456070-7abcd800-9bf5-11e9-8bd8-18eed09b3612.png?ssl=1)

The above results seem very impressive. But are they worth it considering the impact on performance and integration into the scancode workflow ?

The final conclusions  can only be made after training many models of different architectures on the data-set of text files of programming languages and choose the one which have the *best combination of model size, computation requirement, inference time, etc.*

### Data-set:
For programming language classification task, the [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) website is a great place to obtain the data-set. This contains huge amounts of code written in various programming languages (way more than what we need). The quality of data is high. 
Initially, I wrote a scraping script to scrape all the code snippets from the site, it was an easy task, but a bit time-consuming.  **So, I talked to the admins of the site and they let me have a full copy of all the code data on their site**. The data is well structured.
This data should be enough for our task. But still if there is an imbalance in the data for some languages, we can easily fetch more data from GitHub. 

### Pre-processing of data:
First of all, all the text would be chunked into pieces to obtain uniform length code snippets and for the reason that our model would run faster if we train it to make inferences on smaller pieces of text.

```python
snippets = []
content = 'code goes here'
chunk_size = 2048 
for chunk in range(0, len(content), chunk_size):
	snippet = content[chunk : chunk + chunk_size]
	snippets.append(snippet)
```
The next step is to convert the text into lower case and remove all the special characters.

I have experimented with different pre-processing techniques and found that it was better to remove all the special characters because of the following reasons: 
Examine the following code snippet:
```python
class Example:
	def __init__(self, x, y):
		self.x = x
		self.y = y
```
If we tokenize them based on white spaces, we will obtain following tokens:
`['class', 'Example:', 'def', .... 'self.x', 'self.y', 'self,']`

note that `'self.x', 'self.y', 'self,'` are treated as different token even though these tokens almost mean the same thing. A conventional ML model (like SVM, Random forest) may get troubled by this. Therefore it is necessary to replace all special characters by white spaces, so we will obtain:
`['class', 'Example', 'def', .... 'self']` which makes much more sense.

After that, we count the occurrence of each token and apply the following filters:
```python
min_occurane = 5  # Min number of times a word should be present in the dataset.

tokens = [k for k,c in vocab.items() if c >= min_occurane] # Remove the tokens which appear less than 5 times in the data-set since they are not much informative

forbidden = ['copyright', 'ibm', 'corp', 'licensed', 'you', 'apache', 'license', 'licenses', 'org', 'compliance']  # remove some tokens that are present in the 'licence/copyright text' above the code.
tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in forbidden]

tokens = [word for word in tokens if len(word) > 1] # remove single letter words like 'a', 'b', '1', 'e', etc.

tokens = [word for word in tokens if not word.isnumeric()] # remove numbers 
```

Now, we need to vectorize the tokens, there are certain techniques like Doc2Vec, Word2Vec, Term Frequency, TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) .

I chose **TF-IDF** since it is lightweight and performs well over *domain specific tasks*.
*TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.*

Finally, along with text, the file extension would also be fed into the model for training but with a twist - 50 % of the samples would contain incorrect/random extensions so that the model learns more from the vocabulary rather than meta-data as explained in the OctoLingua blog post. This would make the model almost 100 % accurate in real life setting !

*This concludes the pre-processing steps.*


### Training various models:
I trained three models in the [notebook](https://github.com/MankaranSingh/GSoC-2020/blob/master/Programming%20Language%20classification/notebooks/All%20Models.ipynb):

- Deep Convolutional Neural Network 
- XGBoost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

The following results were obtained:

| Model Type             | Accuracy | Inference time (over many files) |
|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Deep Convolutional Net | 0.9844   | 0.219 s                          |
| XGBoost                | 0.9775   | 0.209 s                          |
| Random Forest          | 0.9863   | 0.193 s                          |
| Pygments               | 0.2666   | 0.297 s                          |

We can clearly see that machine learning is clearly a better option over pygments.

### Model Selection:
*I think we should avoid using deep learning because of the following reason:*

Here, the deep learning model, XGboost + TF-IDF and the Random Forest + TF-IDF models perform almost similar. If we use deep learning models, we would have to add tensorflow and keras as a dependency.The Tensorflow package is well over 500 MB and is an overkill for this project as a dependency in my oppinion. On the other hand, the conventional models require only sci-kitlearn and xgboost library which are far more lightweight and easy to install on all operating systems. The deep learning model may outperform other models given huge amount of data. But our tasks of programming anguage classification dosen't seem to be too complex and is fairly modeled by these models.

## File Purpose Classification Task:
The files can be classified into the following categories:

 - Test files
 - Documentation files
 - Configuration files
 - Build scripts
 - Example Scripts
 - Core Code
 - Others (to be discussed)
 
Each of the files belonging to any of the above category has certain characteristics associated with them, for example:

- Certain keywords in filename 
- Certain keywords in file path
- Particular language libraries imported or not
- Ratio of certain keywords in file content vs total number of words
   for example - a high value of content.count('test')/len(count.split()) may indicate a test file.
- File extensions, etc

These features can be extracted in following ways:
```python
def extract_features_from_files(paths):
    
    filenames = []
    test_in_filename = []
    test_in_directory_path = []
    test_word_count = []
    assert_word_count = []
    testing_library_imported_or_not = []
    test_count_in_neighbouring_filenames = []
    
    for path in paths:
	    try:
            with open(path, encoding="utf8") as file:
                content = file.read()
                test_word_count.append(content.count('test'))
                assert_word_count.append(content.count('assert'))
                testing_library_imported_or_not.append('import pytest' in content)
                
        except Exception as e:
            print(path, e)
            continue
            
        filenames.append(os.path.basename(path))
        test_in_filename.append('test' in os.path.basename(path))
        test_in_directory_path.append('test' in os.path.dirname(path))
        
        neighbours = os.listdir(os.path.dirname(path))
        count = 0
        for filename in neighbours:
            if 'test' in filename:
                count += 1
        test_count_in_neighbouring_filenames.append(count)
```

*Note: This is only for 'test' file classification, features for other types can be extracted in a similar way.*

My solution is to extract these features from each file and run them through a model for classification.

**The results can be found in the following [Notebook](https://github.com/MankaranSingh/GSoC-2020/blob/master/File%20purpose%20classification/Some%20Experiments%20with%20SVM%20classifier%20.ipynb)**

The following features were extracted extracted from each file and were used to train a simple SVM classifier to perform a binary classification of *'test vs non test'* files. 

*The data-set was fairly easy to make and could be found in the [repository ](https://github.com/MankaranSingh/GSoC-2020/tree/master/File%20purpose%20classification) .*

**Results** - The model was very easily able to classify the given files. In-fact, the accuracy was almost 100 % indicating that this was an easy classification problem and may be solved via heuristic approach (writing handcrafted rules).

The choice is ours. The advantage of Machine learning is: 

 - No need of thinking and handcrafting rules, just provide some training examples.

The advantage of Handcrafting rules is:

 - Greater flexibility as we can add our own rules without retraining anything.

 Both approaches work, but the final conclusion can only be made after feedback from end-user and discussion with mentors. But nonetheless, both approaches would do the job. 

 We may also use a combination of both approaches like:
 
 - Train a random forest model  
 -  Extract the feature importances and the if-else decisions 
 - Use them to handcraft rules

For example, see the below image:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MankaranSingh/GSoC-2020/master/File%20purpose%20classification/feature_importance.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MankaranSingh/GSoC-2020/master/File%20purpose%20classification/feature_importance.png)
 
 We can see, how important a particular feature is from modelling the current dummy data-set. Great insights, we can definitely keep these in mind while handcrafting rules. 
 
## Dealing With False Positives:

False positives means that the model reports a specific file as something which it isn't, for example:

- Predicting a non test file as a test file
- Predicting a Matlab file as a JS/Python file
- And other similar cases

It would be a better thing if the model reports *'Can't Identify'* rather than something wrong. Currently, methods like pygments do not provide us with any functionality like this.
This can be achieved by increasing the sensitivity of our model and making it more 'precise'. When a model is used to predict something, sci-kit learn provides us with `predict_proba` and `decison_scores` methods which returns the probability of the given sample for all classes it belongs to. The class with highest probability is selected.
What we can do is to set a **thresh-hold** value. So, a prediction would only be considered if the model returns a probability that is at-least greater than the thresh-hold value. 
Therefore, we would only consider a prediction if the model is fairly confident about it, thus avoiding false positives. 

## Tech Stack:

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: Keras, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn (Final library would be selected based upon the best performing model)
- Beautiful Soup: For scraping data from web



# Timeline

- **Pre GSoC :**
I'd focus on collecting the dataset required for training the model by scraping data from the internet. I'd also have make sure that the collected data is well balanced by analysing it though various data analytic techniques and would have to clean the dataset as required. This also makes my task easier in those 12 weeks and helps me concentrate on shipping professional code.

 - **Community Bonding :**
Getting acquainted with the code base and the procedure that needs to be followed to submit code and get it reviewed. Discussing with the team on what exactly needs to be the problem statement (minute details, like kind of dataset we want to use, what parameters should be user choices, like parameters such as for training a newer model, adding a new programming language to the model, specifying a custom model prior to the scan, etc).

- **Week 1**
Understand the relevant parts of the code base and try to figure out how the final product should look like, how these classifiers would be integrated into the existing workflow and what standards we need to follow,

- **Week 2**
This week would be spent upon analyzing and collection of data from the internet. Data cleaning would also be done. Finally, a fully cleaned and structured data-set, that is ready to be fed to machine learning algorithms would be prepared by the end of this week.

- **Week 3 - 4**
This week would be spent on training various types of models. A full report upon the performance of all the models (like inference times, model size, accuracy, ease of integration, etc) would be documented for future reference.

- **Week 5 - 6**
Once the final models are selected, this week would be spent upon integration of these classifiers into the existing workflow.

- **Week 7**
After the model integration, this week would be spent on writing various test cases based upon all the features that were integrated into the codebase in previous weeks.

- **Week 8 - 10**
Take feedback from the community and iterate on the designs and improvise on use cases. Ensure code quality by adding more test cases

- **Week 10 - 11**
Streamlining and standardizing  the ways of training our own custom model if needed

- **Week 12**
Documentation

- **Week 13** 
Spare week in case of some work getting delayed, in case of any emergency or otherwise.
- **Post GSoC**
I will keep on working upon improving the contributions that I will make throughout the project. I will stay as an active member of the community.
